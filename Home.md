**The Difference Between Different Programming Languages**

_C++ Language_

The C++ language has an object oriented structure which is used in large projects. Programmers can collaborate one program into different parts or even one individual work on each part of the program. The structure of object oriented also permit code to be reused many times.This language is an efficient language. But, many programmers will disagree



_C Language_

The C language is a  basic programming language and it is a very popular language, particularly used in game programming, Because C language includes the additional packing of the C++, Every programmer uses this language because it makes programs faster . However the value of this language gives the reusability of C++ to get the slight increase in performance with C language.

_Pascal Language_

Pascal language is mostly a teaching language and few industries uses this language to write the programs. This language tends to use keywords instead of symbols and braces in C language. So this language is very easy for beginners to understand than a programming language like C, C++. Borland is a compiler software company, which is using Delphi programming language for industrial strength. Delphi is an object oriented language of Pascal, and presently  Borland compilers only use it.

_Fortran Language_

Fortran language is a number crunching language and still it is used by scientists. This language allows different sizes of variables up to the memory limit in the machine. This language is suitable for engineers, who have to calculate values with high precision. Program in Fortran is inflexible and sometimes it makes difficult to read.


_Java Language_

The Java language is a multi platform language that’s particularly helpful in networking. Of course, mostly this language is used on the web with Java applets. However, this language is used to design cross platform programs, Since it similar to C++ in structure and syntax. For C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some advantages provided by object oriented  programming. Like reusability and it can be difficult to write efficient code in Java. But, nowadays the speed of the Java language has increased and 1.5 version offers some good features for easy program making.



_Perl Language_

Perl language is a file management language for UNIX. But it is more popular for its common gateway interface programming (CGI). It is a term for programs that web servers can perform to allow additional capabilities of web pages. Pearl language is a method for searching text and it is used for useful server functions and other databases, and it is very easy to pick up the fundamentals if you have any experience in any language. As a CGi language, web hosting services select Perl language over C++ language. Because, the web hosts can review Perl script files. Since they are text files, when C++ is compiled.



_PHP Language_

The PHP language is used to design web pages and sometimes it is also used as scripting language. This language is designed to develop a rapid website, and as a result comprises features which make it easy generate HTTP headers and link to databases. As a scripting language, it includes a set of componentspermit the programmer to easily get up to speed. However, it has more  sophisticated object oriented features.



_LISP Language_

LISP language is mostly used in computer science research and it stores all data in lists such as arrays. The syntax of list is very simple and easy to make for developers to implement structures

_Scheme Language_

The scheme language is an alternate of LISP language, and it has a simpler syntax and features. Any project under the scheme language will result in the re implementation of most of the  LISP language. But, this is very popular introductory language in the computer science department of MIT’s. This language easily solves the problems instead of worrying about syntaxes of programming langu


This is all about the differences between programming languages and few major programming languages are discussed. And, the remaining languages like Tcl, Python, Smalltalk, COBOL, C# and Prolog are similar to the above languages which are discussed. But selecting the suitable language for developing a program or application is very important

**What is the difference between the compilers in C++ programming?**

The differences between compilers in C++ are very large in number .Few of them are : Optimization - routines are completely different. Clang/LLVm or Visual C++ are good for link-time optimization. Economy - some are available for free : GCC, Clang/LLVM, Visual Studio Express, etc. Back-end Tools - are completely different Visual Studio uses masm , link , cl and GCC uses gcc , g++ , cc1 , cc1plus and binutils . Exception Handling - Visual Studio is the "best" in terms of exception handling. Compiler which is mostly used on majority of online judges is the GCC. GCC means the GNU Compiler Collection, it is the front end for a collection of compilers and linkers. When compiling C++ it will usually call g++. As for g++ vs VC++, they are completely different compilers so there are a ton of differences. For example they will optimize code in different ways, they may have minor syntactical differences based on not following the standard correctly, different libraries, different headers, different implementations, etc... g++ can be used to compile projects on various different platforms, whereas VC++ is meant to only compile programs for the Windows platform.

**What are the different c++ standards?**
The C++ standard consists of two parts: the core language and the C++ Standard Library. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes vectors, lists, maps, algorithms (find, for_each, binary_search, random_shuffle, etc.), sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples, input/output facilities (iostream, for reading from and writing to the console and files), smart pointers for automatic memory management, regular expression support, multi-threading library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to be at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that doesn't use C++ exceptions into C++ exceptions, a random number generator and a slightly modified version of the C standard library (to make it comply with the C++ type system).
A large part of the C++ library is based on the Standard Template Library (STL). Useful tools provided by the STL include containers as the collections of objects (such as vectors and lists), iterators that provide array-like access to containers, and algorithms that perform operations such as searching and sorting.
Furthermore, (multi)maps (associative arrays) and (multi)sets are provided, all of which export compatible interfaces. Therefore, using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators. As in C, the features of the library are accessed by using the #include directive to include a standard header. C++ provides 105 standard headers, of which 27 are deprecated.
The standard incorporates the STL that was originally designed by Alexander Stepanov, who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years. When he started with C++, he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms (e.g., STL sort) that perform even better than, for example, the C standard library qsort, thanks to C++ features like using inlining and compile-time binding instead of function pointers. The standard does not refer to it as "STL", as it is merely a part of the standard library, but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library (input/output streams, internationalization, diagnostics, the C library subset, etc.).
Most C++ compilers, and all major ones, provide a standards conforming implementation of the C++ standard library.

**GPA calculate in C++**


// it is use in kust i calculate my gpa that is correct
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    float nmbr, grade, credits, GPA = 0, totalCredits = 0;

    cout << "Enter The Number of Courses: ";
    cin >> nmbr;

    for(int i = 0; i < nmbr; i++){
        cout << "Enter the credit number for course No. " << i+1 << " : ";
        cin >> credits;
        totalCredits =totalCredits + credits;

        cout << "Enter the grade for course No. " << i+1 << " : ";
        cin >> grade;
         GPA =GPA+grade*credits;
    }

    GPA /= totalCredits;

    cout << "The GPA Is: " << GPA << " / ";
    if(GPA >=.7 && GPA <= 1)
        cout << "F oh no";
    else if(GPA >= 1 && GPA <= 1.33)
        cout << "D";
    else if(GPA >= 1.33 && GPA <= 1.7)

    else if(GPA >= 2.63  && GPA <= 3)
        cout << "B-";
    else if(GPA >= 3 && GPA <= 3.33)
        cout << "B";
    else if(GPA >=3.33 && GPA <= 3.63)

    else if(GPA >=3.63 && GPA <= 4)
        cout << "A-";
    else if(GPA == 4)
